Placeholder script for accuracy benchmarking.

A real implementation would:
1.  Take a labeled dataset (e.g., a CSV mapping file paths to 'AI' or 'Human').
2.  Run the `aidetect` tool against each image.
3.  Compare the tool's verdict against the ground truth label.
4.  Calculate and print metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
