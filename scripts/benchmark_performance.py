Placeholder script for performance benchmarking.

A real implementation would:
1.  Select a representative set of test images of various sizes.
2.  Run the `aidetect` tool against each image multiple times to get stable timings.
3.  Calculate and print metrics like average, median, P95, and P99 processing times.
4.  Fail if the median processing time for a standard image size exceeds the target (e.g., 15 seconds).
