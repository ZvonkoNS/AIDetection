## Ensemble Configuration

### Weight Distribution

| Mechanism | Weight | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| METADATA | 25% | Fast, reliable, strong signal when present |
| FREQUENCY | 25% | Robust, catches many generators |
| TEXTURE_LBP | 15% | Effective for GAN detection |

## Expected Performance

### Accuracy Projections

**Before Phase 1** (placeholders only):
- Accuracy: ~50% (random baseline)
- Only metadata doing real analysis

**After Phase 1** (all mechanisms active):
- **Target Accuracy**: 75-85%
- **Expected Improvement**: +25-35 percentage points

### Processing Time

Per-image breakdown (10MB image on modern CPU):
- Metadata: <0.1s
- Frequency: ~1.5s
- Texture: ~0.8s
- Quality: ~0.7s
- Placeholders: ~0.1s
- **Total**: ~3-4 seconds (well within 15s budget)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Dataset Requirements
- **20 Real Photos**: From diverse cameras (Canon, Nikon, iPhone, Samsung, etc.)
- **20 AI Images**: From various generators (SD, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
- **Balanced**: Equal representation across categories
- **Representative**: Various subjects, lighting, quality levels

### Validation Metrics
- Overall accuracy
- Precision (true positive rate)
- Recall (sensitivity)
- F1-score
- False positive rate
- False negative rate
- Confusion matrix

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No actual ML models yet**: XceptionNet and ViT are still placeholders
2. **Limited training data**: Heuristics based on research, not trained on large datasets
3. **Generator evolution**: AI generators constantly improve; signatures may change
4. **Edge cases**: Heavily post-processed photos may trigger false positives

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

1. Replace placeholder classifiers with trained models
2. Add generator-specific fingerprints
3. Implement face-specific analysis
4. Add multi-frame analysis for burst/live photos
5. Continuous learning from new samples
