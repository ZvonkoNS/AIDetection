# AI Detection Tool - Reporting Improvements

## Overview

The reporting system has been significantly improved to provide more structured, user-friendly, and informative results. The improvements focus on clarity, transparency, and helping users understand what the analysis is based on.

## Improvements Summary

### 1. **Text Report Format** (`text.py`)

The text report has been completely restructured with clear sections:

#### New Structure:
- **Header Section**: Clear title with file identification
- **Verdict Section**: Shows the classification with confidence score and level
- **Analysis Methodology**: Explains how the analysis works
- **Key Findings**: Top 3 most significant indicators
- **Detailed Results**: Categorized analysis results
  - Forensic Analysis (metadata, frequency, texture, quality)
  - ML Classification (Xception, ViT models)
- **Technical Details**: File integrity hashes, processing time, etc.

#### Visual Improvements:
- ASCII-compatible visual bar charts for probability scores: `[########........]`
- Clear categorization with section dividers
- Human-readable mechanism descriptions
- Confidence level explanations

#### Example Output:
```
======================================================================
  AI IMAGE DETECTION REPORT
  File: example.jpg
======================================================================

[AI] VERDICT: AI-GENERATED
   Confidence: 60.3% (MEDIUM)
   Moderate confidence - Several indicators support this verdict

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This image was analyzed using multiple independent detection mechanisms:
  * Forensic Analysis: Examines metadata, frequency patterns, compression,
                       texture, and quality metrics
  * ML Classification: Deep learning models trained on AI/real images

Each mechanism provides an AI likelihood score (0-100%), which are
combined using weighted ensemble scoring to produce the final verdict.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. TEXTURE_LBP: 97.0% AI - Unnaturally uniform texture (score: 0.94)
  2. METADATA: 65.5% AI - No camera make/model information

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

+-- FORENSIC ANALYSIS RESULTS
|  Camera & EXIF metadata examination
|    [#############.......] 65.5% AI likelihood
|    > No camera make/model information
|  Frequency domain analysis (DCT patterns)
|    [###########.........] 56.3% AI likelihood
|    > Unusual quantization pattern detected (score: 0.89)
...
```

### 2. **JSON Report Format** (`json.py`)

The JSON output has been restructured to be more semantic and self-documenting:

#### New Structure:
- **report_metadata**: Schema version, report type, analysis framework
- **file_info**: File identification with SHA-256 hash
- **verdict**: Classification with detailed confidence explanation
- **analysis_summary**: Methodology description and key findings
- **detailed_results**: Categorized mechanism results
  - Each mechanism includes name, description, and scores
  - Results separated by category (forensic vs ML)
- **interpretation_guide**: Helps users understand the results
  - Probability score meanings
  - Confidence level explanations
  - Verdict type descriptions

#### Key Features:
- Human-readable descriptions for each mechanism
- Both decimal (0.0-1.0) and percentage (0-100%) values
- Self-documenting structure with built-in interpretation guide
- Clear categorization of analysis types

#### Example Output:
```json
{
  "report_metadata": {
    "schema_version": "1.1.0",
    "report_type": "AI Image Detection Analysis",
    "analysis_framework": "Multi-mechanism ensemble detection"
  },
  "verdict": {
    "classification": "AI-GENERATED",
    "confidence_score": 0.603,
    "confidence_percent": "60.3%",
    "confidence_level": "MEDIUM",
    "explanation": "Several indicators support this verdict with some disagreement"
  },
  "analysis_summary": {
    "methodology": "This analysis uses multiple independent detection mechanisms...",
    "key_findings": [
      "TEXTURE_LBP: 97.0% AI - Unnaturally uniform texture (score: 0.94)",
      "METADATA: 65.5% AI - No camera make/model information"
    ]
  },
  "detailed_results": {
    "forensic_analysis": [...],
    "ml_classification": [...]
  },
  "interpretation_guide": {
    "ai_probability_meaning": "Each mechanism outputs a probability...",
    "confidence_levels": {...},
    "verdict_types": {...}
  }
}
```

### 3. **CSV Report Format** (`csv.py`)

The CSV summary has been expanded with comprehensive analysis data:

#### New Columns:
- **Basic Info**: filename, verdict, confidence_score, confidence_percent, confidence_level
- **Key Finding**: top_finding (most significant indicator)
- **Forensic Scores**: metadata_score, frequency_score, texture_score, quality_score, artifacts_score
- **ML Scores**: xception_score, vit_score
- **Technical Data**: file_size_bytes, processing_ms, sha256_hash

#### Header Comments:
The CSV now includes header comments explaining the data:
```csv
# AI Image Detection Tool - Batch Analysis Summary
# Confidence Score: 0.0-1.0 range, higher = more confident
# Mechanism Scores: AI probability (0.0-1.0), >0.7=strong AI, <0.3=strong human
```

#### Use Case:
Perfect for batch analysis, data analysis in Excel/spreadsheet tools, or integration with other systems.

## Confidence Level Guide

The system now provides three confidence levels with clear explanations:

- **HIGH**: Multiple detection mechanisms strongly agree on the verdict
- **MEDIUM**: Several indicators support the verdict with some disagreement
- **LOW**: Results are borderline or mechanisms show significant disagreement

```

### Batch Analysis (with CSV):
```bash
python run_aidetect.py analyze --input "Test Images"
# Generates individual text reports + summary_report.csv
